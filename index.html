    <h1>Hi, I'm Connor Chan.</h1>
    <h3>I work as a frontend developer.</h3>
    <p>I also don't like building portfolio sites, but I have this domain, so, here we are.</p>
    <p>Currently, I work at <a href="https://upbound.io">Upbound</a>, and if you want a look at what
    I'm capable of, take a look at the website, create an account, explore the app, etc. I've
    primarily helped with building Upbound Cloud and the Registry while occasionally helping to build 
    and enhance our various marketing websites.</p>
    <p>Our tech stack includes React, Redux, TypeScript, GraphQL, Apollo Client, Cypress.io, Jest, Emotion, and 
      more.</p>
    <p>Previously I was at <a href="https://evegage.com">Evergage</a>, where I worked on (and eventually helped to manage)
    the client operations team. I helped to implement Evergage on websites and apps across verticals, using
    HTML, CSS, JS (with some good ol' jQuery) to build integrations and marketing campaigns for 
    both web and email. No, I will not willingly write email HTML again (unless
    the price is right).</p>
    <p>In my free time I like reading books, cooking, watching television, breathing fresh air, and studying Russian.</p>
    <h3>Want to contact me? Have a question? Wanna pay me to build your Evergage campaigns
       (I'm really good and fast at those!)?</h3>

      I on LinkedIn? Well, there really aren't too many and you have all the context clues you need here.
      If you're not capable of finding me on your own, I probably don't want to talk to you.
