    <h1>Hi, I'm Connor Chan.</h1>
    <h3>I work in MarTech.</h3>
    <p>I also don't like building portfolio sites, but I have this domain, so, here we are.</p>
    <p>Currently, I work as a Senior Consultant at <a href="https://www.slalom.com/">Slalom</a>. Primarily, I am a Salesforce 
      Interaction Studio (formerly Evergage) subject matter expert, but am also involved with other projects related to
     Salesforce Marketing Cloud and CDP implementations.</p>
    <p>Prior to that, I worked at <a href="https://upbound.io">Upbound</a> as a Frontend Software Engineer.</p>
    <p>Our tech stack included React, Redux, TypeScript, GraphQL, Apollo Client, Cypress.io, Jest, Emotion, and 
      more.</p>
    <p>Some of the things I helped to maintain and build include the upbound.io site, the crossplane.io site, various docs sites,
    and the UI for Upbound Cloud.</p>
    <p>I also spent time at <a href="https://evegage.com">Evergage</a>, where I worked on (and eventually helped to manage)
    the client operations team. I helped to implement Evergage on websites and apps across verticals, using
    HTML, CSS, JS (with some good ol' jQuery) to build integrations and marketing campaigns for 
    both web and email.</p>
    <p>In my free time I like reading books, cooking, watching television, breathing fresh air, and studying languages.
      I am currently studying Russian and Mandarin.
    </p>

    <p>I am not currently open to new opportunities, but if you have any other inquiry:</p>
    <p>@connorjchan on social media, and I can be reached through LinkedIn, as well, should you find me there.</p>
    <h3>FAQ:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Q:&nbsp;</strong>Are you capable of building an actual contact form?</li>
      <li><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong>Yes. Sounds like a lot of effort for a lot of spam, though.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Q:&nbsp;</strong>Are you going to add CSS to this site? JS? Some animations?</li>
      <li><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong>No.</li>
    </ul>
